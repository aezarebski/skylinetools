## TreeSlicer Tests
Tests to compare the result of using TreeSlicer to obtaining the same or similar results in a more complicated way without it. Note that some XMLs log more statistics than necessary and contain some unnecessary RPN calculators to check correctness of the results. 

### With TreeSlicer

1. `dengue4_bdsky_equidistant5_treeslicer.xml`: 5 intervals for R_e, equally spaced between tmrca and present, sampling proportion 0 before oldest sample.
2. `dengue4_bdsky_fixeddates_treeslicer.xml`: 5 intervals for R_e at specific fixed dates, sampling proportion 0 before oldest sample.
3. `dengue4_bdsky_csc_treeslicer.xml`: 2 intervals for R_e, with the shift-date estimated.


### Comparison xml files (without TreeSlicer)

1. `dengue4_bdsky_equidistant5.xml`: 5 intervals for R_e, equally spaced between origin and present, sampling proportion 0 before oldest sample.
2. `dengue4_bdsky_equidistant5_rootcondition.xml`: 5 intervals for R_e, equally spaced between tmrca and present, sampling proportion 0 before oldest sample (no origin estimated).
3. `dengue4_bdsky_fixeddates.xml`: 5 intervals for R_e at specific fixed dates, sampling proportion 0 before oldest sample.
4. `dengue4_bdsky_csc.xml`: 2 intervals for R_e, with the shift-time estimated.
